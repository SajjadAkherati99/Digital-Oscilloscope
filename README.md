# Digital-Oscilloscope
Oscilloscopes are a laboratory equiepment which has educational application are used to display elctrical signals in circiut design laboratories. 
In this project, I tried to design an oscilloscope with the following specifications:
-  It displays an analog signal that is enters to its channel (sinusoidal or square signal).
-  We can adjust its time per division and volt per division.
-  We can trigger and hold on and display a part of received signal.
